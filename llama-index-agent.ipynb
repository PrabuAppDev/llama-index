    "# Agentic Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup using `FunctionCallingAgentWorker` with Llama Index can be considered an example of agentic architecture. Here's a breakdown of why this approach qualifies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agents and Autonomy**  \n",
    "   - The `FunctionCallingAgentWorker` creates an agent that autonomously decides which tools (query engines) to utilize based on the user's query.\n",
    "   - This makes it an \"agent\" because it can perform actions independently to resolve queries. For instance, the agent autonomously decides which section of the manual to query to answer a question.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tool Integration**  \n",
    "   - The agent is integrated with \"tools\" (`QueryEngineTool`), which provide specific capabilitiesâ€”in this case, querying the Acura manual data.\n",
    "   - This tool integration is central to agentic architecture as it allows the agent to perform specialized tasks using pre-defined functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reasoning and Function Calling**  \n",
    "   - The `FunctionCallingAgentWorker` allows the agent to reason and call specific functions as needed based on the user's prompt.\n",
    "   - This setup enables the agent to make decisions and take actions, such as querying the Acura manual for specific information like resetting the oil change light.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Differences from a Basic Query System\n",
    "- A basic query system only returns search results without processing or reasoning, while the agentic approach \"thinks through\" the required steps.\n",
    "- Agentic architecture enables multiple decision-making steps and tool usage, adding sophistication beyond simple query-response mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "- **Modularity**: Additional tools can be added to the agent, enabling it to autonomously decide when to use each one.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: The agent can scale to handle complex, multi-step queries and interactions, making it more versatile than a basic query engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this setup leverages principles of agentic architecture, enabling it to dynamically and autonomously interact with users' queries. This is beneficial for scenarios that require more than simple responses, making it capable of sophisticated, contextualized interactions."
